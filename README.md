# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 5

Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

### Task Completed

This submission fulfills the requirements of Task 5, which was to perform data analysis on traffic accident data, identify patterns related to contributing factors, and visualize accident hotspots.

### Methodology:

- **Data Acquisition:** Collected traffic accident data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing data and ensured that the dataset was in a usable format for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed EDA to understand accident trends by city, state, weather, and year.
- **Data Visualization:** Created visualizations to highlight accident patterns and identify contributing factors.

### Visualizations:

- **Weather Conditions During Accidents:** Created a bar plot to display the distribution of weather conditions during accidents to identify the most common conditions in which accidents occurred.
  
- **Accident Trends by Year:** Visualized the number of accidents per year to observe the trend in traffic accidents over time.

- **State-wise Accident Distribution:** Developed a bar plot showing the states with the most and least number of accidents to understand geographic accident patterns.
  
- **City-wise Accident Distribution:** Visualized the top 10 cities with the highest and lowest accident counts to compare traffic accident severity and density by city.

- **Accident Severity Distribution:** Created a pie chart to illustrate the distribution of accident severity levels, categorizing them into four severity levels (1, 2, 3, and 4) for a clearer understanding of accident severity.

- **Accident Location Scatter Plot:** Created a scatter plot showing accident locations by latitude and longitude, categorized by state and accident severity.

### Key Findings from Traffic Data Analysis:

1. **City-wise Accident Distribution:** 
   - **Miami** recorded the highest number of accidents, likely due to its dense population and high traffic volumes.
   - Cities like **Star Junction** and **Stromsburg** reported the fewest accidents, corresponding to their smaller populations and lighter traffic.

2. **State-wise Accident Distribution:**
   - **California** had the most accidents, consistent with its extensive road network and high population.
   - **South Dakota (SD)** had the fewest accidents, likely due to its lower population and traffic density.

3. **Yearly Accident Trends:** 
   - The year **2021** recorded the highest number of accidents, suggesting either increased traffic or better reporting systems during that period.

4. **Accident Severity Levels:**
   - Most accidents were classified as **severity level 2**, indicating that while accidents were frequent, the majority were not highly severe.

5. **Weather Conditions During Accidents:** 
   - A majority of accidents occurred in **fair weather**, indicating that factors other than poor weather, such as driver behavior or traffic conditions, were more influential in causing accidents.

### Tools and Libraries:

- Python
- Pandas
